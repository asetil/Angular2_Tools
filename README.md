Angular2 Date Picker Component
-----------------------------------
Are you lookig for a simple component to use for date picking? What about angular material
datepicker at https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview 

Actually i tried to use it firstly with great effort. First "Install Angular Material and Angular CDK", then add "Animations" then bla bla.
But this must not be so hard to add a simple component to a project. At this point i came out with an idea of why i'm not writing my own
component. And aw_datepicker was born.

Just add "datepicker.component.ts" file to your Angular Components folder. From App.Module register it via NgModule.
Create your custom css for appereance or use my "datepicker.css" codes for default appereance. And lastly use it like at "demo.html"

For icons like "fa fa-calendar" i'm using "Font-Avesome" and "Twitter Bootstrap" handle big job at background.

Just this, change it, play with it, create your own one for your need, have fun..
