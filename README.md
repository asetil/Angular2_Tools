Angular2 Date Picker Component
-----------------------------------
Are you lookig for a simple component to use for date picking? What about angular material
datepicker at https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview 

Actually i tried to use it firstly with great effort. First "Install Angular Material and Angular CDK", then add "Animations" then bla bla.
But this must not be so hard to add a simple component to a project. At this point i came out with an idea of why i'm not writing my own
component. And <b><u>aw_datepicker</u></b> was born.

To use it with minimum effort, just <b>datepicker.component.ts</b> file to your "Angular Components" folder. Then register this new componenet from your "App.Module" via NgModule. Just this!

To customize ppereance you can apply any css you want or for default appereance use css codes from <b><u>datepicker.css</u></b> file.

And lastly, to use it in your form as form control, check usage <b><u>demo.html</u></b> file

For icons like "fa fa-calendar" you can use "Font-Avesome", and for css styling "Twitter Bootstrap" can be used.

Play with it, change it for your own purpose. That's all!
